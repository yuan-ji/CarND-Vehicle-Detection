    "**Vehicle Detection Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. \n",
    "* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](writeup_images/cars.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example using the `YUV` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=9`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](writeup_images/Hogs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried various combinations of parameters. I first tried to extract eht HOG features of `orientations =9 `, ,`pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)`, and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`. But I than found that it spends too much time to extract the HOG features and the feature vecture becomes especially long. So I decided to use the parameter of `pixels_per_cell=(16, 16)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained a linear SVM using the function from sklearn.svm library.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate vehicle center\n",
    "svc = LinearSVC()\n",
    "svc.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In order to trained the linear SVM, I did the following stuff.\n",
    "I first split the features into two train and test sets with the functions `train_test_split`.  I than use the `StandardScaler` to normolized the data. After that the SVM will be trained. At last the accuracy is given by using `svc.score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried verious combination to get a higher accuracy. I found that, if the color features (bin sptial and hist features) is added, the accuracy is higher. But the vector of the features is bigger, and the the rate of false positive becomes also higher. So I decided remove the color features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Sliding Window Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "I first used the lesson functions `search_windows` to extract the feature of each windows. It's is not effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](writeup_images/sliding_windows.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus I used the `find_car` functions to just ectract the features onece. I than search the window positions at several scales as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "\n",
    "    scales  = [1.0, 1.0, 1.5, 1.5, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0]\n",
    "    ystarts = [400, 416, 400, 432, 400, 432, 400, 464]\n",
    "    ystops  = [464, 480, 496, 528, 528, 560, 596, 660] \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately I searched on two scales using HLS 3-channel HOG features. Here are some example images:\n",
    "\n",
    "The results is as follows.\n",
    "![](writeup_images/find_cars.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still several false positives.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](output_images/project_video_output.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](writeup_images/heat.png)\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  \n"
